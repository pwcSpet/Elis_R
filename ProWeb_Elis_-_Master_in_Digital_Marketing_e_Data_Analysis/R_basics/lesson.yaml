- Class: text
  Output: In this lesson, we will explore some basic building blocks of the R programming
    language.

- Class: text
  Output: If at any point you'd like more information on a particular topic related
    to R, you can type help.start() at the prompt, which will open a menu of resources
    (either within RStudio or your default web browser, depending on your setup).
    Alternatively, a simple web search often yields the answer you're looking for.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: In its simplest form, R can be used as an interactive calculator. Type
    5 + 7 and press Enter.
  CorrectAnswer: 5 + 7
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='5 + 7')
  Hint: Type 5 + 7 and press Enter.

- Class: text
  Output: R simply prints the result of 12 by default. However, R is a programming
    language and often the reason we use a programming language as opposed to a calculator
    is to automate some process or avoid unnecessary repetition.

- Class: text
  Output: In this case, we may want to use our result from above in a second calculation.
    Instead of retyping 5 + 7 every time we need it, we can just create a new variable
    that stores the result.

- Class: text
  Output: 'The way you assign a value to a variable in R is by using the assignment
    operator, which is just a ''less than'' symbol followed by a ''minus'' sign. It
    looks like this: <-'

- Class: text
  Output: Think of the assignment operator as an arrow. You are assigning the value
    on the right side of the arrow to the variable name on the left side of the arrow.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: To assign the result of 5 + 7 to a new variable called x, you type x <-
    5 + 7. This can be read as 'x gets 5 plus 7'. Give it a try now.
  CorrectAnswer: x <- 5 + 7
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('x <- 5 + 7', 'x <- 7 + 5')
  Hint: Type x <- 5 + 7. It's important to include a single space on each side of
    the assignment operator, but do NOT put a space between the `<` and the `-` that
    form the arrow.

- Class: text
  Output: You'll notice that R did not print the result of 12 this time. When you
    use the assignment operator, R assumes that you don't want to see the result immediately,
    but rather that you intend to use the result for something else later on.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: To view the contents of the variable x, just type x and press Enter. Try
    it now.
  CorrectAnswer: x
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='x')
  Hint: Type x and press Enter. This will automatically print the value of x.
